# Project 3 - Problems vs. Algorithms

## 1 - Finding the Square Root of an Integer

Find the square root of the integer without using any Python library.
You have to find the floor value of the square root.

For example if the given number is 16, then the answer would be 4.

If the given number is 27, the answer would be 5 because `sqrt(5) = 5.196` whose floor value is 5.

The expected time complexity is `O(log(n))`

Here is some boilerplate code and test cases to start with:

```python
def sqrt(number):
    """
    Calculate the floored square root of a number

    Args:
       number(int): Number to find the floored squared root
    Returns:
       int: Floored Square Root
    """
    pass

print ("Pass" if  (3 == sqrt(9)) else "Fail")
print ("Pass" if  (0 == sqrt(0)) else "Fail")
print ("Pass" if  (4 == sqrt(16)) else "Fail")
print ("Pass" if  (1 == sqrt(1)) else "Fail")
print ("Pass" if  (5 == sqrt(27)) else "Fail")
```

## 2 - Search in a Rotated Sorted Array

You are given a sorted array which is rotated at some random pivot point.

Example: `[0,1,2,4,5,6,7]` might become `[4,5,6,7,0,1,2]`

You are given a target value to search. If found in the array return its index, otherwise return -1.

You can assume there are no duplicates in the array and your algorithm's runtime complexity must be in the order of `O(log n)`.

**Example**

Input: `nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 0, Output: 4`

Here is some boilerplate code and test cases to start with:

```python
def rotated_array_search(input_list, number):
    """
    Find the index by searching in a rotated sorted array

    Args:
       input_list(array), number(int): Input array to search and the target
    Returns:
       int: Index or -1
    """
    pass

def linear_search(input_list, number):
    for index, element in enumerate(input_list):
        if element == number:
            return index
    return -1

def test_function(test_case):
    input_list = test_case[0]
    number = test_case[1]
    if linear_search(input_list, number) == rotated_array_search(input_list, number):
        print("Pass")
    else:
        print("Fail")

test_function([[6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 1, 2, 3, 4], 6])
test_function([[6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 1, 2, 3, 4], 1])
test_function([[6, 7, 8, 1, 2, 3, 4], 8])
test_function([[6, 7, 8, 1, 2, 3, 4], 1])
test_function([[6, 7, 8, 1, 2, 3, 4], 10])
```
