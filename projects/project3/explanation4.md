# Problem 4 - Dutch National Flag Problem

The algorithm sorts the array in-place with one iteration over the array.
It is a variant of the quicksort algorithm.

Time complexity for this problem is `O(n)` and space complexity for this problem
is `O(1)`. We only need to keep track of the three pointers
`current, next_zero, next_two`.
