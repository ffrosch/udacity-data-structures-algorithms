# Problem 4 - Dutch National Flag Problem

The algorithm sorts the array in-place with one iteration over the array.

Time complexity for this problem is `O(n)` and space complexity for this problem
is `O(n)`, as the array is sorted in place an thus the space taken used is
proportional to the length of the array.
