# Problem 6 - Max and Min in a Unsorted Array

Finding the minimum and the maximum in an unsorted array is pretty
straightforward and can be done in `O(n)` time by keeping track of the lowest
and highest value seen.

Space Complexity of this problem is `O(1)` because three variables for keeping
track of highest, lowest and current number are always used, independent of the
length of the array.
